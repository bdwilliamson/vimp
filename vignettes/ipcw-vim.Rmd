## Introduction

In some settings, we don't have access to the full data unit on each observation in our sample. These "coarsened-data" settings (see, e.g., @vandervaart2000) create a layer of complication in estimating variable importance. In particular, the efficient influence function (EIF) in the coarsened-data setting is more complex, and involves estimating an additional quantity: the projection of the full-data EIF (estimated on the fully-observed sample) onto the variables that are always observed (Chapter 25.5.3 of @vandervaart2000; see also Example 6 in @williamson2021). 

## Coarsened data in `vimp`

`vimp` can handle coarsened data, with the specification of several arguments:

* `C`: and binary indicator vector, denoting which observations have been coarsened; 1 denotes fully observed, while 0 denotes coarsened.
* `ipc_weights`: inverse probability of coarsening weights, assumed to already be inverted (i.e., `ipc_weights` = 1 / [estimated probability of coarsening]).
* `ipc_est_type`: the type of procedure used for coarsened-at-random settings; options are `"ipw"` (for inverse probability weighting) or `"aipw"` (for augmented inverse probability weighting). Only used if `C` is not all equal to 1.
* `Z`: a character vector specifying the variable(s) among `Y` and `X` that are thought to play a role in the coarsening mechanism. To specify the outcome, use `"Y"`; to specify covariates, use a character number corresponding to the desired position in `X` (e.g., `"1"` or `"X1"` [the latter is case-insensitive]).

`Z` plays a role in the additional estimation mentioned above. Unless otherwise specified, an internal call to `SuperLearner` regresses the full-data EIF (estimated on the fully-observed data) onto a matrix that is the parsed version of `Z`. If you wish to use any covariates from `X` as part of your coarsening mechanism (and thus include them in `Z`), and they have *different names from `X1`, ...*, then you must use character numbers (i.e., `"1"` refers to the first variable, etc.) to refer to the variables to include in `Z`. Otherwise, `vimp` will throw an error.

## Example

Consider the following example. Here, we observe outcome `Y` and covariate `X1` on all participants in a study. Based on the value of `Y` and `X1`, we include some participants in a second-phase sample, and further measure covariate `X2` on these participants. This is an example of a two-phase study. We generate data as follows:
```{r generate-data}
set.seed(4747)
p <- 2
n <- 100
x <- replicate(p, stats::rnorm(n, 0, 1))
# apply the function to the x's
y <- 1 + 0.5 * x[, 1] + 0.75 * x[, 2] + stats::rnorm(n, 0, 1)
# make this a two-phase study, assume that X2 is only measured on
# subjects in the second phase; note C = 1 is inclusion
C <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = exp(y + 0.1 * x[, 1]) / (1 + exp(y + 0.1 * x[, 1])))
tmp_x <- x
tmp_x[C == 0, 2] <- NA
x <- tmp_x
x_df <- as.data.frame(x)
full_df <- data.frame(Y = y, x_df, C = C)
```

If we want to estimate variable importance of `X2`, we need to use the coarsened-data arguments in `vimp`. This can be accomplished in the following manner:
```{r ipw-vim}
library("vimp")
library("SuperLearner")
# estimate the probability of coarsening
ipc_weights <- 1 / predict(glm(C ~ y + V1, family = "binomial", data = full_df), 
                           type = "response")

# set up the SL
learners <- c("SL.glm", "SL.mean")
V <- 2

# estimate vim for X2
set.seed(1234)
est <- vim(Y = y, X = x_df, indx = 2, type = "r_squared", run_regression = TRUE, 
           SL.library = learners, alpha = 0.05, delta = 0, C = C, Z = c("Y", "1"), 
           ipc_weights = ipc_weights, cvControl = list(V = V), env = environment())
```
