\arguments{
\item{Y}{the outcome.}

flexible estimation technique regressing Y on X in the training data. Provided as
either (a) a list of length V, where each element in the list is a set of predictions on the
corresponding validation data fold; or (b) a vector, where each element is
the predicted value when that observation is part of the validation fold.
If sample-splitting is requested, then these must be estimated specially; see Details.}

\item{cross_fitted_f2}{the predicted values on validation data from a
flexible estimation technique regressing either (a) the fitted values in
\code{cross_fitted_f1}, or (b) Y, on X withholding the columns in \code{indx}.
Provided as either (a) a list of length V, where each object is a set of predictions on the
corresponding validation data fold; or (b) a vector, where each element is
the predicted value when that observation is part of the validation fold.
If sample-splitting is requested, then these must be estimated specially; see Details.}

then this argument is not used.}

\item{f2}{the fitted values from a flexible estimation technique
regressing either (a) \code{f1} or (b) Y on X withholding the columns in
\code{indx}. If sample-splitting is requested, then these must be
estimated specially; see Details. If \code{cross_fitted_se = TRUE},
then this argument is not used.}

\item{indx}{the indices of the covariate(s) to calculate variable
importance for; defaults to 1.}

\item{V}{the number of folds for cross-fitting, defaults to 5. If
\code{sample_splitting = TRUE}, then a special type of \code{V}-fold cross-fitting
is done. See Details for a more detailed explanation.}

\item{run_regression}{if outcome Y and covariates X are passed to
\code{vimp_accuracy}, and \code{run_regression} is \code{TRUE},
then Super Learner will be used; otherwise, variable importance
will be computed using the inputted fitted values.}

\item{SL.library}{a character vector of learners to pass to
\code{SuperLearner}, if \code{f1} and \code{f2} are Y and X,
respectively. Defaults to \code{SL.glmnet}, \code{SL.xgboost},

in computation? (defaults to \code{FALSE})}

these identify the observations that should be used to evaluate
predictiveness based on the full and reduced sets of covariates, respectively.
Only used if \code{run_regression = FALSE}.}

folds be stratified based on the outcome (helps to ensure class balance
across cross-validation folds)}

\item{C}{the indicator of coarsening (1 denotes observed, 0 denotes
unobserved).}

\item{Z}{either (i) NULL (the default, in which case the argument
\code{C} above must be all ones), or (ii) a character vector
specifying the variable(s) among Y and X that are thought to play a
role in the coarsening mechanism. To specify the outcome, use \code{"Y"}; to 
specify covariates, use a character number corresponding to the desired
position in X (e.g., \code{"1"}).}

inverse probability weights for coarsened-at-random settings).
Assumed to be already inverted (i.e., ipc_weights = 1 / [estimated
probability weights]).}

\item{scale}{should CIs be computed on original ("identity") or
logit ("logit") scale?}

\item{ipc_est_type}{the type of procedure used for coarsened-at-random
settings; options are "ipw" (for inverse probability weighting) or
"aipw" (for augmented inverse probability weighting).

\item{scale_est}{should the point estimate be scaled to be greater than 0?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
Compute estimates of and confidence intervals for nonparametric
deviance-based intrinsic variable importance. This is a wrapper function for
\code{cv_vim}, with \code{type = "deviance"}.

\details{
We define the population variable importance measure (VIM) for the
group of features (or single feature) \eqn{s} with respect to the
predictiveness measure \eqn{V} by
\deqn{\psi_{0,s} := V(f_0, P_0) - V(f_{0,s}, P_0),} where \eqn{f_0} is
the population predictiveness maximizing function, \eqn{f_{0,s}} is the
population predictiveness maximizing function that is only allowed to access
the features with index not in \eqn{s}, and \eqn{P_0} is the true
data-generating distribution.

Cross-fitted VIM estimates are computed differently if sample-splitting
is requested versus if it is not. We recommend using sample-splitting
in most cases, since only in this case will inferences be valid if
the variable(s) of interest have truly zero population importance.
The purpose of cross-fitting is to estimate \eqn{f_0} and \eqn{f_{0,s}}
on independent data from estimating \eqn{P_0}; this can result in improved
performance, especially when using flexible learning algorithms. The purpose
of sample-splitting is to estimate \eqn{f_0} and \eqn{f_{0,s}} on independent
data; this allows valid inference under the null hypothesis of zero importance.

Without sample-splitting, cross-fitted VIM estimates are obtained by first
splitting the data into \eqn{K} folds; then using each fold in turn as a
hold-out set, constructing estimators \eqn{f_{n,k}} and \eqn{f_{n,k,s}} of
\eqn{f_0} and \eqn{f_{0,s}}, respectively on the training data and estimator
\eqn{P_{n,k}} of \eqn{P_0} using the test data; and finally, computing
\deqn{\psi_{n,s} := K^{(-1)}\sum_{k=1}^K \{V(f_{n,k},P_{n,k}) - V(f_{n,k,s}, P_{n,k})\}.}

With sample-splitting, cross-fitted VIM estimates are obtained by first
splitting the data into \eqn{2K} folds. These folds are further divided
into 2 groups of folds. Then, for each fold \eqn{k} in the first group,
estimator \eqn{f_{n,k}} of \eqn{f_0} is constructed using all data besides
the kth fold in the group (i.e., \eqn{(2K - 1)/(2K)} of the data) and
estimator \eqn{P_{n,k}} of \eqn{P_0} is constructed using the held-out data
(i.e., \eqn{1/2K} of the data); then, computing
\deqn{v_{n,k} = V(f_{n,k},P_{n,k}).}
Similarly, for each fold \eqn{k} in the second group,
estimator \eqn{f_{n,k,s}} of \eqn{f_{0,s}} is constructed using all data
besides the kth fold in the group (i.e., \eqn{(2K - 1)/(2K)} of the data)
and estimator \eqn{P_{n,k}} of \eqn{P_0} is constructed using the held-out
data (i.e., \eqn{1/2K} of the data); then, computing
\deqn{v_{n,k,s} = V(f_{n,k,s},P_{n,k}).}
Finally,
\deqn{\psi_{n,s} := K^{(-1)}\sum_{k=1}^K \{v_{n,k} - v_{n,k,s}\}.}
