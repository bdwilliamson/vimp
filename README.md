## Introduction

In predictive modeling applications, it is often of interest to determine the relative contribution of subsets of features in explaining an outcome; this is often called variable importance. It is useful to consider variable importance as a function of the unknown, underlying data-generating mechanism rather than the specific predictive algorithm used to fit the data. This package provides functions that, given fitted values from predictive algorithms, compute algorithm-agnostic estimates of population variable importance, along with asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the true importance and hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis of zero importance.

Specifically, the types of variable importance supported by `vimp` include: difference in population classification accuracy, difference in population area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, difference in population deviance, difference in population R-squared.

More detail may be found in our papers on [R-squared-based variable importance](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13392),  [general variable importance](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.2003200), and [general Shapley-based variable importance](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/williamson20a.html).

This method works on low-dimensional and high-dimensional data.

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an issue](https://github.com/bdwilliamson/vimp/issues).

## R installation

You may install a stable release of `vimp` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vimp/index.html) via `install.packages("vimp")`. You may also install a stable release of `vimp` from GitHub via [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) by running the following code (replace `v2.1.0` with the tag for the specific release you wish to install):

```r
## install.packages("devtools") # only run this line if necessary
devtools::install_github(repo = "bdwilliamson/vimp@v2.1.0")
```

You may install a development release of `vimp` from GitHub via [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) by running the following code:

```r
## install.packages("devtools") # only run this line if necessary
devtools::install_github(repo = "bdwilliamson/vimp")
```

## Example

This example shows how to use `vimp` in a simple setting with simulated data, using `SuperLearner` to estimate the conditional mean functions and specifying the importance measure of interest as the R-squared-based measure. For more examples and detailed explanation, please see the [vignette](https://bdwilliamson.github.io/vimp/introduction_to_vimp.html).

```r
## load required functions and libraries
library("SuperLearner")
library("vimp")
library("xgboost")
library("glmnet")

## -------------------------------------------------------------
## problem setup
## -------------------------------------------------------------
## set up the data
n <- 100
p <- 2
s <- 1 # desire importance for X_1
x <- as.data.frame(replicate(p, runif(n, -1, 1)))
y <- (x[,1])^2*(x[,1]+7/5) + (25/9)*(x[,2])^2 + rnorm(n, 0, 1)

## -------------------------------------------------------------
## preliminary step: estimate the conditional means
## -------------------------------------------------------------
## set up the learner library, consisting of the mean, boosted trees,
## elastic net, and random forest
learner.lib <- c("SL.mean", "SL.xgboost", "SL.glmnet", "SL.randomForest")

## the full conditional mean
full_regression <- SuperLearner::SuperLearner(Y = y, X = x, family = gaussian(), SL.library = learner.lib)
full_fit <- full_regression$SL.predict

## the reduced conditional mean
reduced_regression <- SuperLearner::SuperLearner(Y = full_fit, X = x[, -s, drop = FALSE], family = gaussian(), SL.library = learner.lib)
reduced_fit <- reduced_regression$SL.predict

## -------------------------------------------------------------
## get variable importance!
## -------------------------------------------------------------
## get the variable importance estimate, SE, and CI
vimp <- vimp_rsquared(Y = y, f1 = full_fit, f2 = reduced_fit, indx = 1, run_regression = FALSE)
```
